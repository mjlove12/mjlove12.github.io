Yesterday was Em's 30th birthday and our last full day in Munich. We have spent most of our time here drinking liter beers and today was no exception.

For most of the afternoon, we explored the massive English Gardens. We played rummy, laid on the lawn and watched surfers try to navigate the river. When we got tired of roaming around, we went to one of the beer gardens enclosed within the park. There are few places in the world that are more enjoyable than a German beer garden. The beer is plentiful, there is excellent people watching and everyone is in a good mood. Munich has some of the oldest beer culture and that comes with extra tradition that makes the whole experience very authentic even if you find yourself sitting next to some Americans from South Dakota.

In general, we loved Munich. It is very pedestrian and bike friendly, beautiful, old and modern at the same time. We feel like we came at the right time, just a week after Octoberfest. We avoided a lot of crowds but still got some beautiful fall weather.
