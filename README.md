# gatsby-starter-blog
Gatsby starter for creating a blog

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:

`gatsby new gatsby-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog`

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`


## Deploying

Please note that the master branch is automatically generated during deployment. To update this, run:

`npm run deploy`

The source branch is where the actual commits are tracked for the code and markdown.

## Misc

`gatsby develop` breaks when gastby-cli is upgraded. Not sure why this is the case right now, but can be fixed by rolling back to gatsby-cli@beta
