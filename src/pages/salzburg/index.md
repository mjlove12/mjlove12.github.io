Salzburg was not initially on our places to visit during our trip, but travelling directly from Arosa to Munich proved to be difficult. We are so glad of this "detour" as it really helped to round out our time in Bavaria. 

Compared to the other cities we went to Salzburg was the quietest. It had the perfect atmosphere for us. It's big enough to offer lots of sites, history and food, but small enough to be walkable and relaxing. There were so many bikers everywhere, and although we were told that Salzburg was very touristy, we mostly encountered locals, and we didn't have to deal with any crowds whatsoever.

We spent one of our full days in Berchtestaden exploring the Obersalzburg Documentation Center. This is a small exhibition in the mountains that documents the period that the area was used as Hitler's Furher's Off Limits area. It was sort of a secondary command post for the Nazi's and was the place where they... Alghouhg heartbreaking to see, we found the site really helpful. Definitely get the audioguide if you go, because almost all of the displays are in German. 

We wanted to do a lot more in Berchtestaden but it's so spread out that it made that too difficult. For that reason, we are glad we stayed in Salzburg and the ride to Berchtestaden was really quick and easy.
