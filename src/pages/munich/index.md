Yesterday was Em's 30th birthday and our last full day in Munich. We have spent much of our time here in large beerhalls and gardens drinking liter beers and today was no exception.

We spent the afternoon relaxing inside the massive English Gardens which has multiple beer gardens. We played rummy (see score below), laid on the lawn and watched surfers try to navigate the river. There are few places in the world that are more enjoyable than a German beer garden. The beer is plentiful, there is usually excellent entertainment and people watchinging and the overall mood is one of comraderie and fun. Everyone is welcoming, sharing their picnic tables. Munich has some of the oldest beer culture and that comes with extra tradition that makes the whole experience very authentic even if you find yourself sitting next to some Americans from South Dakota.

PICTURES OF THE PARK

In general, we loved Munich. It is very pedestrian and bike friendly, beautiful, old and modern at the same time. We feel like we came at the right time, just a week after Octoberfest. We avoided a lot of crowds but still got some beautiful fall weather.
