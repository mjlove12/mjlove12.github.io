Our last stop in Europe has been one of the best. We spent the last 3 days in Amsterdam with some college friends. Amsterdam may be the most livable city we have encountered, with bikes, boats and trams everywhere and surprisingly little car traffic. People are out and about at every time of the day.

We have had the most incredible hosts here that made our stay extra special. We even took a ride on their boat, navigating all the little canals and docking at a brewery for some drinks.

As for attractions, we saw the Van Gogh museum and the Anne Frank house during our last full day in Europe. The first one was well organized, but we didn't think it was worth the high price tag<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. The Anne Frank House was definitely worth it. I have been re-reading the diary on the kindle for the past couple weeks and the museum gives really great insight and perspective.

We spent our last night finishing our rummy 5,000 game, reminiscing on our trip, and drinking beer with our friends. For the past week, we've been saying that we are ready to be home and sleep in our own bed. But now that it's here, we just feel nostalgic. We started to talk about our favorite parts of our trip and I think we will turn that into a nice little "superlatives" post.

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: Entrance fee is 18 euros per person and the audio guide (which we did not get) is 5 euros. Although his paintings are undeniably creative, I have to ask the question: are there more talented artists that we overlook because they kept both ears intact?
