Throughout the whole trip, we kept asking eachother "what has been your favorite place so far"? This is a really common thing we ask our friends when they take a trip, but we have started to think it is too vague oe a question. What do we mean by favorite anyways? Favorite experience? Best city? Best attractions? Best food? There's a lot of ways to break these down, so we will list some of our thoughts below in a series of superlatives.
