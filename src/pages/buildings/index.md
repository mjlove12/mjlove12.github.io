During our trip so far, we have already seen many amazing churches. Two stick out in my mind - Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Duomo in Milan. Both churches are amazingly beautiful. They both employ the same Gothic techniques and styles. They are simple techniques, repeated over and over in different variations. This repetition, and attention to detail, produced over time leads to an overall effect that is overwhelming. 

In both places, we just stood and looked around for a long time. In both cases, you had this feeling that you just couldn't put it altogether. It's too much. I think this is because it's beyond one man's imagination. Both churches are the work of many architects, painters, sculptures, builders, etc. etc. Both were built over an unimainabley long time, with Notre Dame being built from 1100 - 1300, and the Duomo constructed over a period of 600 years!

When you look at these buildings, you aren't looking at a central human design as much as something more like an emergent system. It's more like a city than it is a building, more like the economy than it is a single business. 

That's why it is so overwhelming. There are many parts that came together, that the original desginers of the building never inteded. And even though they had the grandest aspirations, the original planners could not have imagined how these buildings look today. 

Examples? The dome that Napolean added to the Duomo after 500 years of construction! The classical touches that that one guy added to the Duomo. THe fact that the Duomo has stained glass windows from the 1300's and 1800's.

Both buildings requried an abundance of time and human collaboration. When you combine these two things, it can lead to the most awe inspiring (or terrifying) effects. It's what is playing out in open source software. It's what has already played out with the Hedron Collider, peer reviewed science...

In a way, these churches are a microcosm of a city itself. Take Paris. The city has transformed so many times over the years, with it's first real landmarks we see today breaking ground in 1100. Even though there have been many "city planners" throughout the years, much of the city has "emerged" over time. I don't think that anyone would have imagined that when Notre Dame was built, that the Paris skyline would be dominated by a giant wire structure, with no purpose except an aesthetic one.

Or that the narrow medieval streets would be largely replaced by wide avenues and 5 story buildings with black sloped roofs.

This emergent property is so much more apparent in an old city like Paris than it is in younger cities like those in America. But our cities will continue down a similar path. We will keep the old things we like (Baltimore Row Homes) and add new things as we go along. With time and collaboration, humans can build amazing things. But to be careful, maybe we should abide by the open source software rule - make sure you leave it better than when you took it.
