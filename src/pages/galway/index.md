We have always wanted to travel to Ireland, but knew little about local geography. Luckily we have many friends who have visited the country and a couple that lived there for a while. They all told us to focus on the west coast, so after flying there from Germany, we went straight to Galway and stayed there for 4 nights. We are really glad we did this, becuase Galway was perfect for us. I would describe it as a big town rather than a small city. I can't figure out if everyone knew eachother or if people there were so friendly that it just seemed that way. Either way, we found it to be the coziest and friendliest place we visited. 

We took two day trips during our time there. On our first full day, we went to the Cliffs of Moher and walked around.

For our second day trip, we went to the largest of the 3 Aran Islands and rented bikes. This was by far the better of the two day trips and one of our favorite activities of the whole trip.

On our third full day, we were considering a day trip to Dublin. We both were interested in the Guiness Brewery and I've always wanted to go to the Trinity College Library. But we liked Galway so much that we both decided to just stay and explore the area. We walked along the promenade and just relaxed - it was one of the most peaceful days of our trip.

Of course, the real thing we went to see in Ireland were the pubs. We were not dissapointed. We drank a lot of beer, watched locals, listen to traditional Irish Music, and even did some Irish dancing of our own! 

Oh, and did I mention how friendly Irish people are? We were looking at a menu outside a bar once trying to figure out where we should eat dinner, and an Irish couple was leaving the bar. They looked at us and said "you alright"? I replied that we were just looking at the menu. They promptly told us not to eat there and then walked us through the neighborhood suggesting places to eat.
